Could do this with a variation of 'wall' ... 
instead of wall being true/false make it be 'roughness' 0-10.0 ,
 and then multiply the heuristic by the spot's roughness 
 (oridifficulty to move through that spot)
   Then you will never get a blocked path,
    but it should find a path of least resistenence....
